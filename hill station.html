<p> A hill station is a town located at a higher elevation known for its cool climate, beautiful scenery, and peaceful environment.
A hill station is a town or settlement situated at a higher elevation than the surrounding plains or valleys, often characterized by cooler temperatures, making them popular destinations for escaping the heat, particularly during summer. In India, many hill stations were developed during British colonial rule as retreats from the plains.
